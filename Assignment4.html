        <h1>Trinidad</h1> 
            <p>Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the two major 
                islands of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies 11 km
                 (6.8 mi) off the northeastern coast of Venezuela and sits 
                 on the continental shelf of South America. It is often 
                 referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. </p>

        <h1>Thailand</h1>
            <p>My rule of thumb is to budget 1000 Baht a day for 
                accommodation in Thailand if you want somewhere clean, 
                comfortable and with air-con. This is an average figure 
                because hotel prices are not consistent across Thailand.</p>

        <h1>Las Vegas</h1>
            <p>Las Vegas, officially the City of Las Vegas and often known 
                simply as Vegas, is the 28th-most populated city in the 
                United States, the most populated city in the state of 
                Nevada, and the county seat of Clark County.</p>
